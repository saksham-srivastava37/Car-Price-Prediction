<h2>Overall Steps Included</h2>

<h4>1.First of all the data was scraped from Quikr.com (https://quikr.com)<h4>
<h4>2.Link for data: https://github.com/saksham-srivastava37/Car-Price-Prediction/blob/main/quikr_car.csv</h4>
<h4>3.The data was cleaned and analysed.</h4>
<h4>4.Then a Linear Regression model was built on top of it which had 0.92 R2_score.<h4>
<h4>5.Link for notebook: https://github.com/saksham-srivastava37/Car-Price-Prediction/blob/main/Car%20Prediction.ipynb<h4>

<h3>This project was given the form of an website built on Flask where we used the Linear Regression model to perform predictions.</h3>
